Have the computer play a game (or as many N games as you'd like) entirely on its own. The program will print the final state of each of the N games and their respective scores for you to observe as it runs as well as the average and highest score across these N games.

This program was built to explore the basic concepts of the Minimax algorithm in a modified fashion. I first implemented the rules of the 2048 game before writing methods to actually have the computer play the game.

NOTE: I believe I referenced https://medium.com/@bartoszzadrony/beginners-guide-to-ai-and-writing-your-own-bot-for-the-2048-game-4b8083faaf53
for basic conceptual help, but this was a couple years ago and cannot completely remember. I definitely looked up a general algorithm to follow to build this program, so I do not completely claim this as my own... it was built for educative purposes for myself.

To have the computer play 2048, download the java file and run it in your preferred IDE. You will be prompted to enter how many games you'd like the computer to
play. After doing so, you'll see the final result of each game as the program runs in addition to the final score of each game and the highest and average scores across all games.
